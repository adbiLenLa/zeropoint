(11b3paky) two rigid bodies collide.  imagine that these rods are incompressible.  
the sound of the collision will propagate through the rods at a finite speed.  
likewise, a photon produced at the moment of collision will propagate through the rod, 
which is transparent to the frequency of the generated pulse.  

the problem for relativity is that the force of the collision will propagate through the rods 
with zero latency.  we know the speed of sound and we know the speed of light, but what is the 
speed of force in an incompressible medium?  we do not need the rod to be ideal in order to 
measure the speed of force.  recent experiments have enabled researchers to photograph a pulse of 
light moving through water.  try the same experiment with two glass rods colliding and measure 
the speed of force relative to the speed of light.

i am in a curious position. i know that newton and einstein are wrong about division by zer0. 
no thought experiment involving common sense and slow-moving trains will be able to describe 
simultaneity on a cosmic scale.
