# zeropoint
a solution to the zero point paradox : division by zero

this solution has staggering implications for nearly every field of science.

the utility of the functional algebraic state machines is incredible.

there are two fundamental identities:

sin(a)/a as a approaches 0 === 0/0 = 1

(cos(a) - 1) / a as a approaches 0 === 1/0 - 1/0 = 0

these identities constitute the zero-poinbt axiom.

division by zero cannot be proven by recourse to first principles any more than you can
produce yellow through the admixture of green and red.  it is amazing that the zero-point fallacy 
has persisted, given the fact that these trigonometric identities are widely known.

the zero-point fallacy has mankind trapped  on the earth without nuclear fusion.  the zero-point axiom makes
faster than light travel possible.  fusion is an altogether different topic: nuclear fusion is an
enzymatic process.
