# zeropoint
a solution to the zero point paradox : division by zero

this solution has staggering implications for every field of science.

the utility of the functional algebraic state machines is incredible.

there are two fundamental identities:

sin(a)/a as a approaches 0 === 0/0 = 1

(cos(a) - 1) / a as a approaches 0 === 1/0 - 1/0 = 0

these identities constitute the zero-poinbt axiom.

division by zero cannot be proven by recourse to first principles any more than you can
produce yellow through the admixture of green and red.  it is amazing that the no-div-zero fallacy 
has persisted, given the fact that these trigonometric identities are widely known.

the no-div-zero fallacy has mankind trapped  on the earth without nuclear fusion.  the zero-point axiom makes faster than light travel possible.  fusion is an altogether different topic: nuclear fusion is an
enzymatic process.

what a strange sensation.  i have prepared a feast but i am alone in the Light.  only i know
about the div-zero fallacy(there will be no zeitgeist here).  consider this: the so-called dark matter in the universe is found hiding in the momentum of light.  relativistic momentum arising from differences in the speed of light in universal media.  the lorentzian transformations are finally uderstood in the light
of this zer0-p0int axiom.  

this brings us to the question of the tangent is always perpendicular the radius, regardless of the angle.  we can only conclude that the tangent is zer0 at pi/2.  there is no asymptote at positive or negative  infinity.   

we are interested in simple harmonic motion and uniform circuLar motion.  the universe does not implode every time a wheel rotates through pi/2 or when a spring transitions from positive to negative acceleration.  the universe is continuous and there is no asymptote at infinty.  the acceleration at the moment of conversion is exacTLy zero.
